Glowstone Wire
==============

Glowstone Wire is a mod that adds aesthetic place-able glowstone wires. The wires do not interfere with any mechanism in vanilla Minecraft, including redstone.

A configuration file is created on first run that can be modified to change the block ID and color of the wire.
